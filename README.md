# RiotAPIProject
This project utilizes the company Riot's collected data from their massive-multiplayer
online game, League of Legends. There's a lot of websites that generate statistics
for players, ranging from how they perform with a specific champion (playable
character) to what item sets are best for a champion. I attempted to simulate this
kind of statistic generation.
